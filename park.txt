                My research <strong><em>accelerates</em> and <em>automates</em> unsupervised ML</strong> (e.g., <strong>anomaly detection</strong>): (1) how to speed up large-scale learning tasks with <strong>ML systems</strong> and (2) how to <strong>automate</strong> unsupervised ML model selection and hyperparameter optimization.
                I build AI/ML applications in finance, healthcare, and security.
